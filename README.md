# API_project
In this project I have created an API using a framework called FASTapi in python. In this I have implimented the GET,POST,UPDATE and DELEtE operation to represent how a basic api work over http protocol.
I have hosted this api on local host using 'Uvicorn'which is an ASGI web server implementation for Python. I have created an api as a Person object to fetch details, to add a person and to delete a person.
